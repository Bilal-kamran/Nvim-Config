## Installation
To use this configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-kamran/Nvim-Config.git ~/.config/nvim
Install Neovim: Ensure you have Neovim installed. You can install it using your package manager.

Install Plugins: Open Neovim and let lazy.nvim handle the installation of plugins.

If you want to add some plugins that you like simply add a new file in the plugins directory and return a table that tells lazy which plugin to download, then configure the plugin to your liking.

Configuration
This configuration is organized into different files for easier management:

init.lua: Main configuration file.

keymaps.lua: Custom key mappings. The keymaps are taken form "ThePrimeagen".

settings.lua: General settings and options.

plugins: The plugins directory contains files that returns lua tables of each plugin with their keymaps and settings.

lazy.lua: Checks if you already have lazy installed if not then it clones it.

Keymaps
Custom key mappings are defined in keymaps.lua, all of them are taken from ThePrimeagen.

Feel free to customize the key mappings to fit your workflow.

Plugins
Plugins are managed using Lazy, a modern plugin manager. The plugins directory contains the list of plugins along with their configurations. Some essential plugins included:

telescope.nvim: Fuzzy finder for files and more.

nvim-treesitter: Syntax highlighting and code parsing.

lualine.nvim: Status line plugin.

nvim-lspconfig: Language Server Protocol configurations.

Lazy Loading
To optimize performance, some plugins are set to load lazily. The lazy.lua file contains these configurations. This ensures plugins are only loaded when needed, improving Neovim's startup time.
